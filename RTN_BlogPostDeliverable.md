The aim of our project is to explore and attempt to help with the issues of public transport in Melbourne.

It is quite easy to find article upon article complaining about overcrowded transport, faulty myki cards, a lack of Myki Top up machines and endless complaints about AOs.

Nearly every day commuters are faced with delays, late buses and trains, or being plagued by ticket inspectors. This issue is a huge challenge to solve, so our solution will attempt to assist commuters in their daily struggles.

According to the Herald Sun, "Customers made 282 complaints against authorized officers this financial year." Among these reports were ticket inspectors using overly "heavy handed" approaches at dealing with ticket evading. Which even lead a woman to be "traumatised" by ticket inspectors.

When we use public transport in Melbourne, we may often be stressed by running late. Add being hassled and intimidated by ticket inspectors on top of this and for some it may be too much. Being stopped and interrogated by Authorised Officers (AO's) or ticket inspectors can often unnecessarily slow down legitimate paying commuters on their trips.


Road To Nowhere will uncover the true problems within Melbourne's public transport system and provide a useful web application to help travellers find the fastest most hassle free route around Melbourne's transport system.

Postgraduate students are also blatently denied concession status despite them still being students. PHD or Masters students do not earn any more money than undergraduate students. How is this fair? This application does not intend to make fair evasion possible but instead help level the playing field.

#    Week 3 Blog Post - Road To Nowhere

Due to ethical reasons, we have decided to change our approach to the issue of transport in Melbourne, instead targeting the lack of communication on PTV's behalf in giving its customers important information about their travel route. This important information includes the ability to discover whether a bus, train, or tram is running late, is too difficult to access, or is not readily accessible.

There are already services available that offer similar functionality, but are severely limited in their scope, that we have listed below:

For buses: there are "Smart Buses", which offer an ability to see how far away the bus is. However, this is limited to a particular set of busses which run only in Melbourne's East, and the information is not readily accessible online or in an app format.

For trams: a solution called tramTRACKER currently exists, however the scope of the app is restricted to only trams. In addition, finding the correct stop you are closest to is an issue, as the app simply gives you a large list of all nearby stops, based on your location, causing users to have to trawl through it to locate their desired stop.

For trains: there are displays at stations which tell you how far away a train is, but that information is not readily available to customers who are, for example, online or on a connecting tram. This information is also delayed in reaching customers and only high profile problems or accidents are ever reported, leaving small inconvenient delays unreported, which frustrates affected users.

PTV recommends "checking their website for updates", however this provides lists of unordered information for every single service and it is difficult and time-consuming to locate information specific to a route. Our app will aim to allow users to save or favourite a specific route in order to show that user notifications based on that particular route. In this way, the user will always be made aware of current or upcoming works, and other potential sources of delays, on their route. The PTV site also only notifies users who have "...subscrib[ed] to PTV's weekly travel update email" about upcoming railway works, unless user actively looks up their train line.

In addition, upon accessing a line or route within the PTV phone app, there are no notifications about upcoming railway work on that specific route, or current work being undertaken. However, it does proceed to notify the user if the Journey planner aspect is being used, leading to some small inconsistencies in what may possibly have been a consistent streamlined process.

The underground stations within the city loop, and some outside of it, often have in excess of 8 exits, and getting the wrong one can leave you 2 or more city blocks away from where you intended to be, costing you up to 10 minutes in bad cases. Travellers who are unfamiliar with these stations can be overwhelmed and will often just follow the first exit sign they see. These stations often have exits leading to at least 4 different streets, and though the exits may be marked, it is not always evident which street you are heading for. Some travellers have taken to this forum to share their preferred carriage for exiting at different stations.

This isn't quite a solution to the problem but something along these lines could be very helpful, for instance: with the knowledge of where the train is arriving from and what carriage the traveller is on, a solution could suggest to the passenger to turn left or right upon exiting the train to get to their desired exit. A basic map that is oriented to the direction they are facing could also be useful. 


Our aim is to attempt to provide a solution to unify all the currently available, but inadequate, solutions into one user driven application which will attempt to report delays live and to update all users down the line regarding the delays that will affect them. The application will attempt to map any user reported issues to help consumers visualise where any issues are. Bundled into the proposed application are minor features including notifications about when Concession Cards are expiring, low money notifications, notifications letting the user know when their last train will be, and simple time saving tips such as where to exit a station.
